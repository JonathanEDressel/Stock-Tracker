<h1>Portfolio Tracker</h1>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<span>I'm brining this project to a close. Why? Well, because of many issues but it all boils down to one thing, design. I wanted a website that could handle 
tons of data. Since this was a stock app and we were needing tons of calls to the backend for stock information, our current implementation wouldn't be the best
 fit. This is due to Razor Pages. Out of my excitement to use Razor Pages and become more affiliated with it, I made the fatal flaw of using a framework 
that isn't the best with handling tons of data. </span>

<span> Despite this mistake, I still learned a lot. I learned the difference between a single page application and multi page application. I learned about
how to create my own back end in Python and route calls between C# and Python. I was able to implement API security with rate limiting and prevent some injection attacks.
Since starting this project and working on other projects, I learned how to use good designs with HTML/CSS. I renewed my understanding of handling basic CRUD operations.
</span>

<span> Overall, I would say this was a success. Why would I consider a proejct that I am abandoning to be considered a success? Because I learned something. Even though 
I developed a poor application, I know more now than I did before I started the project. That's what I see as valuable when working on side projects.
